Glory Fit has been wonderful to use but lately been having an issue with the watch faces not showing up in my dial center. I have a smartwatch and now purchased a Ruimen watch. Both watches work with the same app. I had done an update a few days back and the dail center was empty. I have uninstalled the app and installed with no luck. please fix issue otherwise I'm stuck with original face on Ruimen. Thank heaven I saved some faces on my smartwatch-other wise everything else works great.,4,0,3.6.9,2025-03-16 14:20:42,3.6.9,1

Watch constantly disconnects from app and now it wont give me any notifications. Even when I bought the watch a month ago...i wouldnt get notifications from my spouse or sister but id receive them from everyone else. Ive tried deleting the app and resetting my watch and it still wont work. The screen wont turn on when rotating my wrist anymore either. I checked and all of my settings are on.

Doesn't seem to be very user friendly especially with syncing contacts!! The people I communicate the most with don't show up in my gloryfit contact list. It be nice to be able to at least manually add new contacts as well. GLORY FIT PLEASE! Do an update so that we can add our contacts that we want to use. Instead of the app choosing which contacts to sync. I get notifications from people I rarely interact with. The contacts I do text and talk to don't show up on the gloryfit contacts!

The way this app drains my phone's battery to less than half in just over an hour from a full charge even when I'm not using it is insane. Why does it need to have such high battery priority?? Last night my phone was at 80%.. I didn't even touch it.. and a little over an hour later my phone had died completely. I uninstalled the app. Will only install it to update the time or whatever if I need to then immediately uninstall. This is ridiculous. Definitely not recommended.,1,4,,2024-08-14 13:07:05,,3105

The calories and steps are very much off compared to my heart rate monitor and android device. Not sure why. It says during an hr work out I burned 50 cal but my heart rate monitor and smart phone both agreed it was 565. Step wise currently watch says 6281 and other devices agree its 3672. Is there an update to sync things better. Since it's NOT compatible with the Samsung health app I was hoping it would be more accurate. Maybe an update would help.

The app is ok. Although the main feature that I want it for is to measure my steps and the graph on it is terrible. I can't change the week to start at on Monday.

Works unreliably. On the first two attempts the App didn't go past the go to settings screen. On clicking settings and allowing for background activity nothing happenef. On clicking ignore I was allowed to choose my gender and then nothing happened. On the third attempt a button appeared and everything went smoothly. The App seems to interfere with other Fitness Apps though. So I uninstalled it. Making a call through the Watch-App-Interface did work.

"The app is so bad I had to return the watch. No control whatsoever on the behavior of the watch. The notifications are always coming with sounds and, once disabled, they keep coming. Having an alarm on your watch is useful to not wake others in the room but the app doesn't allow you to chose if the alarm comes with or without sound.

You need location on all the time for the weather to update. My watched stopped tracking my sleep out of the blue. It was one of the main reasons I got it. I also think they should add more faces.

For the most part this APP works fairly well.

Beware this company offers to pay for fake reviews. *some* of the features work........ Most aren't actually doing anything. The BP never changes. Because it doesn't actually measure your BP.

Blood ox also never changes because it can't measure that either.,2,0,3.4.1,2024-02-06 03:54:42,3.4.1,5485

The activate the watch face when you raise your arm works sometimes if you have that feature turned off and press the button to see the time it may or may not work. App has alot of features but is useless if they don't WORK. 12/26/23 These people don't care this app has issues. All they say is we are working on it.

The worst app ever! It doesn't let me add anything apart from the sleep record to the main screen. The readings are very inaccurate too. Im a very healthy and fit person and just the other day it was showing that i get only 90% of co2 if that were true I would be dead.. and if I werent fit and feeling fantastic this would probably really freak me out. The heart rate monitor is also not accurate because i checked it with the medical machine. And the weather is not updating. I could go on...,1,9,3.2.7,2023-08-03 10:45:46,3.2.7,8138

"I was hoping for an easy app to use. I am not tech savvy. I tried to change the watch face twice, but it reverted back to the original and so I have given up on that.

The blood sugar says I am doing well, but because the blood pressure isn't accurate, I don't trust it. It does fine counting my steps, but does not record if I do elliptical or other exercise.

I Have have had this watch since April of last year. The app Worked well for a few weeks. But has gotten less useful as time passed. The app crashes regularly now and seems to use a lot of power. Currently the operating system puts it in low power mode cause of the problems. So now the app is useless. Update as of July 5th 2023. Allowed all permissions & set power to allow background use.

The app worked one day and now keep crashing,1,0,3.1.4,2023-04-30 22:33:41,3.1.4,9583
Worked great at first. But now it crashes after each sync (which is anytime I open the app). I can't ever use any of the fitness trackers or really any of the features that come on my watch because the app can't stay open long enough to do anything. Really the only thing that has somehow worked is unpairing the watch reseting it and opening the app up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app too. All things I really shouldn't have to keep doing. Especially with how frequently the app crashes.,2,49,3.1.4,2023-04-30 22:02:22,3.1.4,9584

"Constructive feedback, doesn't perform well for shift work, it expects you to be in bed by 10pm and no option to change it, so sleep monitor is massively inaccurate, I now feel this app is more of a security risk, with its sudden reset and demand to want access to all my files, camera etc, Its done a self reset so everything needed to be synced back up with my watch.

I haven't been able to get this app working properly on Android except for step counting. All I want is to log exercise but if I initiate and end in the smartwatch then the session disappears and is not logged anywhere. If I initiate in the app then the app crashes and when it restarts the Bluetooth is disconnected. My understanding is that the exercise needs to be initiated and end in the app to be logged which I cannot do. It also has a Swimming Mode but the manual says it cannot go in water.,1,32,3.1.0,2023-01-12 13:49:52,3.1.0,10812

"The original version was great. Since then two revisions have been issued and both revisions are buggy and crash.

"Pros: Battery lasts 8 days & charges in less than 2 hours. (I only use the health diagnostics and have all the other notifications turned off). Detailed info is quickly available on the app., unlike my fitbit that took forever to sync with my phone. Cons: Heart rate readings are so inaccurate. The watch will give a reading above 100 compared to my fingertip oximeter, wrist blood pressure cuff and even a manual check will be in the low 50's! I can't get the body temp. or weather to read in Fahrenheit . Most of the watch faces look like they were made for a child's watch. They are cluttered with graphics and multiple colors making it hard to get info at a glance. Very few show the battery level and only 1 gives the actual battery percentage. There is no way to track basic workout activities like elliptical, rowing or weight training. But they list badminton and yoga!

The weather is horrible. It says it's using my location but it's not. I can trick it into using my location for about a minute then it changes to another location.

"This watch SW206, L28 is inaccurate for BP. Change your age and get a new BP value. For example, put 70 and get consistently 184/84, put 50 and get 125/70. Nothing close to measured values. Numbers are pre-set and don't change. Totally unacceptable. HR monitoring inaccurate. Calories count is over estimated and off by as much as 135% from mio fuse and 200% from strava. Bad deal.

"Some days my steps on my watch don't match with the steps in the app. If I'm trying to track my dance class, none of the settings work, so I don't know the steps that I'm taking when I do my workouts. Then there are times that I can get up and start walking and if it's not 40 steps then it doesn't count it so there's multiple times throughout the day that I walk but they're not counted. Trying to get my steps to link from this app to other apps is a no go!! I have to manually put them in!!",3,49,2.6.0,2021-08-23 04:12:37,2.6.0,16574

"Thanks for the great app. This has been a very helpful app for me to track my daily workouts. A question I have here. is it possible to get the data out of the app or from the smart watch in an automated manner (not by typing the reading manually in a spreadsheet)? I have certain goals regarding my weight and body fat. I have a separate measurement scale (weight, BMI, body fat and a lot more) from where I have managed to collect the data automatically. Now I would like to merge my steps, calories burned etc. from this app/smart watch to see how my goals are getting met by doing the regular workouts. Is there a way to get the data out? I am attempting to build my own separate react-native app to connect to the device (Bluetooth Low Energy), I am able to read the characteristics of everything available from the device but I am not yet able to interpret the actual reading of ""steps"" and other readings from the device. Sorry for asking this question in the review section here.

There's only preset dials nothing that you can choose yourself. Biggest problem I have is once a week for some random reason it stops calculating steps. For that fix I just unbind it disconnected from the phone and turn it off turn it back on and reconnect and it will calculate steps again.

App does not show blood oxygen levels The sports app does not work i have the Blitzwolf bw hl3 smart watch maybe a compatibility issue because it is a new watch and the app is not fully compatible with this product Kind regards,4,4,2.3.1,2021-01-07 09:34:57,2.3.1,17973

I don't know what happened I was having trouble with wrong no readings and the app just stoping right in the middle of the cycle. So I came on to play store and put in firmware update glory fit and it brought me to an app so I downloaded the app and all of a sudden it is giving true no reading but I can't see how this app could make a difference because it is a separate app at least it shows up as a separate app but it is made to run thru my blitz wolf watch so who knows,5,9,2.2.8,2020-11-08 06:09:43,2.2.8,18207

"Worked until an apparent update by either Skygrand or Gloryfit. Now, the watch, Skygrand3194, will not connect to Gloryfit. Everything appears to be normal when attempting to connect my Android based Pixel3 Excel to the Skygrand watch using Gloryfit until an attempt is made to make the actual connection. Gloryfit recognizes the Skygrand 3194 watch but refuses to connect to it. I've tried multiple times to make the connection including shutting the watch on and off, the Pixel3 Excel phone on and off, uninstalling Gloryfit and then reinstalling it, and reviewing and verifying passwords on the cell phone. To my knowledge, no password exists on the Skygrand watch. Currently, Gloryfit is a piece of junk and unusable. The watch's usefulness is compromised and is little more than a watch that measures pulse rate, steps taken, and distance. Unless there is someone who can help me through this imbroglio, I'll have to discard the watch and get a superior one, perhaps from Apple, Fitbit, or the better watches on Amazon. Phone support from Gloryfit would be the most desirable.

The watch works extremely well. It syncs when i open the ap. occasionally the ap will need to be restarted to sync. I dont get weather but thats not a big deal.It counts my steps and takes blood pressure. my only issue is that it doesnt track my sleep past 9 in the morning. it will also stop tracking sleep if you get up to go to the bathroom. As far as units of measure you can change them from metric to imperial in the ap settings. it took me a minute to find it when i was setting it up.,4,6,1.7.1,2018-12-30 01:44:06,1.7.1,18449

"Don't get me wrong, the watch and the app look ok, but there are a ton of flaws in both. For example, my watch clasp never seems to stay hooked. I've tried tightening it, loosening it, clasping it, I've tried everything and it still falls off 90% of the time. I have to reclasp it almost every 10 minutes and I'm afraid it might fall off while working. Another example would be my watch was running low on battery and I went to charge it with the charger it came with. The first time I charged it, it worked fine, but this time after about 30 minutes or so, I heard it vibrating like crazy. I went to check on it and turn it on, but now it won't even turn on! It will still vibrate when I plug it in, but the screen is completely dead and I can't do anything on it anymore. On top of all that, the watch RARELY connects to the app! It connected maybe once or twice, but every time, I tried restarting my phone, turning Bluetooth on and off, turning the watch on and off, but it NEVER connected! Plus when the watch said it was connected to my phone, any changes I made in the Settings on the app never applied to the watch itself (it stayed on 24 hour time and stayed in Celcius when I wanted 12 hour time and Farenheit.) Really the only good thing about this watch is that it can count my steps. Buyers beware, it's best to buy a different smartwatch or a different product, this one is faulty.",1,18,1.6.5,2018-11-17 05:03:02,1.6.5,18464

Like most of the watch owners my app does not work. Keeps crashing. I like the looks and function of the watch but the app sours that experience. Is there a previous app version that did work?,1,1,1.4.6,2018-04-01 20:31:58,1.4.6,18531

Crash everytome. This causes notifications not being delivered so it easy to miss a call or sms. Blood pressure works bad. Sleep tracking shows random values very often. If you want to lose 40$ buy this shity fitness bracelet.,1,0,1.4.3,2018-03-28 18:06:47,1.4.3,18533

"Perfect app. I have had this exercise watch for 2 weeks now. This is a very good watch, at first I was not sure. But I joined wee chat &  Every thing is working very well.

There are several issues and bugs. One the cycling icon disappears on its own and you can track any other sport except running or walking a jump rope. It's hard to navigate. You can not customise the clock to your watch. You can not update the weather or sync it it take three syncs before it updates. There is not enough options to decide which notifications you want to choose. It has Facebook but not Instagram which is a known communication app. It gives you the option for phone and message notification but even if you cut on it does not do anything. For me I think that there is a lot of potential but there are way too many bugs.,1,1,1.4.3,2018-02-28 00:40:02,1.4.3,18543
Since I got the watch and downloaded this app the app workes for a few days and then started crashing every time I tried to open it. Completely unusable.

Can't log in; app is usable.  Going to the doctor today for an actual check up...going to compare medical equipment's stats to what this app says are my stats.... The actual paired device is not always reliable and does not respond to touch to select or switch functions.
